## Project 1
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. 
The development for Project 1 are contained in the [Project1- InsertionSortAlgorithm.py](https://github.com/ebrudiler/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Projects-for-Patika.dev/blob/main/Project1-%20InsertionSortAlgorithm.py).

  *  Worst-case time complexity- O(n^2)
  *  Best-case time complexity - O(n)
  *  Average time complexity - O(n^2)

## Project 2

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. 
The development for Project 2 are contained in the [Project1- InsertionSortAlgorithm.py](https://github.com/ebrudiler/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Projects-for-Patika.dev/blob/main/Project1-%20InsertionSortAlgorithm.py).
